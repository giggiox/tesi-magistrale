Trench coats come in several different lengths, but this is a common length. Long trench coats can come down past the knee or even just above the ankle.\nWhich of the following options is the most plausible continuation?\n1. Long trench coats are ideal for taller people, but they may make short people appear even shorter.  Wear shoes with a heel if you're a shorter person wearing a long trench coat.\n2. Select a coat that reaches just below the knees to help accentuate your figure. If you're tall, look for trench coats that reach the shins, or underarms.\n3. Trench coats are long for coats made by men so you want to choose one with a solid material.  Trench coats come in different lengths, such as a waist length trench coat, a neck length trench coat, or a shoulder length trench coat.\n4. Several styles of trench coats have ties that can be worn flat to look outfit-appropriate, or in a wide variety of styles, depending on which pant line you choose.

The US abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar, whose value was left to \"float\" (rise and fall according to market demand). Shortly thereafter, Britain followed, floating the pound sterling. The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies. Anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time, the industrialized nations increased their reserves (by expanding their money supplies) in amounts far greater than before. The result was a depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations' currencies. Because oil was priced in dollars, oil producers' real income decreased. In September 1971, OPEC issued a joint communiqué stating that, from then on, they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold. Question: When did OPEC  issue a joint communique?

During the Second World War, Warsaw was razed to the ground by bombing raids and planned destruction. After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled PRL. Most of the historical buildings were thoroughly reconstructed. However, some of the buildings from the 19th century that had been preserved in reasonably reconstructible form were nonetheless eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g. Leopold Kronenberg Palace). Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of Eastern bloc countries. Question: What does Warsaw's mixture of architectural styles reflect?

Founded as a broad Islamist coalition in 1989 it was led by Abbassi Madani, and a charismatic Islamist young preacher, Ali Belhadj. Taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liberalization and secularization by the ruling leftist-nationalist FLN government, it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following Sharia law, economic liberalization and development program, education in Arabic rather than French, and gender segregation, with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young Algerian men.
